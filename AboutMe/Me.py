### Welcome!

I'm a Master's student at **UC Berkeley** with a **strong professional background** in **software engineering** and **data science**. With nearly two years of experience **collaborating cross-functional teams**, I specialize in:

- **Process automation that scales**
- **Building interpretable and interactive data visualizations**
- **Communicating technical results clearly to non-technical audiences**

Iâ€™m passionate about delivering **actionable insights** and always strive to be a **reliable and empathetic teammate**. Iâ€™ve consistently received positive feedback from my managers and supervisors, and I look forward to connecting with you.

> Appreciate that you would take some time in exploring me :)
