#### My role on the team:
**Software Development Engineer** on the Platform Performance team. 

#### Project ideation:  
- Help performance engineers efficiently detect downgrades 
- Automate and improve the analysis of performance test results
- Reduce manual effort and enabling faster, more accurate identification of regressions 
- Addressing key challenges in data analysis, Jira management, and report generation.

#### Business impact:  
- Helps performance engineers quickly validate application performance during daily regression testing. 
- It has greatly reduced manual analysis time, improved visibility of test outcomes, and streamlined Jira ticket generation.
- Faster CI/CD cycle, application maintainence and update.
- Increase customer satisfaction.

#### Project planning:  
Collaboratively planned with engineers on the design and original structure. Designed to be a minimum viable product(MVP).
                
> Streamlit supports both fronted and backend
>
> No large-scale ETL operations
>
> Minimal (not optimal) Infrastructure need
>
> No complex ML model
>
> Automatic jira creation with log
>
> Have its own database for regression and jira tracking

#### Major milestones:  
- Test results Analyzer - Display interactive plots on elapsed time / test result comparison  
- Outlier detection - Use ML model to detect elapsed time outliers  
- Jira Manager - Use ML model to identify downgrade, and enable Jira creation upon detection 
- Automated Reporter - Connecte API into the Jenkins pipeline to achieve automated application downgrade detection
- Inteligent Ticket - Identify correlated tickets and decide whether to comment or create
                
#### Level of responsibility held:  
Design, implement, and maintainence of above modules.
                
#### How was it built:  
Our tool uses a modular design with Flask and Python-based data processing pipelines. Integrated with Jenkins and Jira for ticket management.
Data was stored at AWS S3. All models were deployed to Sagemaker.

#### Outcome:  
TAP is now widely adopted by the Performance team and expanding to other infrastructure teams. 
                It enables scalable, reproducible analysis, and has improved test triage accuracy and efficiency.

#### Key Learnings:  
- Solid backend development of industry level project using python  
- Open-ended task resolution
- From vague problem to exicuable solution
- The value of collaboration and direct user feedback in evolving tool design

#### My role on the team:  
Backend Developer Intern ‚Äì designed and migrated data systems

#### Project ideation:  
Built a platform to manage and query trading records with product data entries.

#### Business impact:  
Improved data integrity and query performance; modernized outdated architecture.

#### Project planning:  
Focused on schema design, backend logic, and system migration.

#### Major milestones:  
- Designed MySQL schema with C3P0 connection pooling  
- Migrated platform using Spring MVC and Hibernate  

#### Level of responsibility held:  
Backend ownership, database design, and system performance

#### How was it built:  
Chose Spring stack for Java-based backend, Hibernate for ORM. Focused on efficiency and modularity.

#### Outcome:  
Faster query performance and a scalable backend used by internal product teams.

#### Key Learnings:  
Gained deep understanding of Java Spring ecosystem, and value of modular service architecture.
